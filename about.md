# About Me

<div class="about-layout">
  <div class="about-main">
    <p>
      I have always been drawn to patterns — whether in football tactics, musical structure, or the way data reflects real-world systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the University of Alberta, this curiosity has developed into a focused interest in data science through courses in statistics, data analysis, and database systems. I learned how data can be structured, analysed, and turned into insights that support better decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then, I have been building dashboards, analysing trends, and working with Python, R, SQL, and Power BI to transform raw data into practical, usable information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, I am pursuing Computing Science with a growing focus on data science, business analytics, and visualization. I am particularly interested in projects where data can clarify complex problems and support policy, operations, or strategic choices.

      Outside work, I enjoy performing and exploring music alongside football, reading, and cooking.

### Outside the Data World

- I follow European football closely and enjoy the tactical and analytical side of the game.  
- Music is a creative outlet where I compose, experiment with melodies, and perform when I can.  
- I enjoy reading about habits, routines, time management, and thoughtful biographies.  
- Cooking is often my way to slow down and reset between academic and project work.

At my core, I am motivated by using data and technology to make complex problems easier to understand and act on.

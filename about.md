# About Me

<div class="about-layout">

  <div class="about-main">
    <p>
      I have always been drawn to patterns, whether in football tactics, musical structure, or the way data reflects our world.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the University of Alberta, this curiosity developed into an interest in data science through courses in statistics, data analysis, and database systems. 
      I learned how data can be structured, analysed, and turned into insights that support better decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then, I have been building dashboards, analysing trends, and working with Python, R, SQL, and Power BI to transform raw data into practical, usable information.

## Outside the Data World

<ul>
  <li>I follow European football closely and enjoy the tactical and analytical side of the game.</li>
  <li>Music is a creative outlet where I compose, experiment with melodies, and perform when I can.</li>
  <li>I enjoy reading about habits, routines, time management, and thoughtful biographies.</li>
  <li>Cooking is my pause button when life starts moving too fast.</li>
</ul>

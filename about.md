# About Me

<div class="about-layout">
  <div class="about-text">
    <p>
      I have always been drawn to patterns—whether in how teams move on a football pitch, 
      how melodies repeat in music, or how numbers guide decisions in organisations.
    </p>

    <p>
      That curiosity developed into a focus on data. Through coursework in statistics, data analysis, 
      and database systems at the University of Alberta, I learned how information can be structured, 
      analysed, and translated into practical insight.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since then, I have been working with Python, R, SQL, and tools like Power BI to build dashboards, 
      analyse trends, and support policy and business decision making. I am currently pursuing a 
      B.Sc. in Computing Science with a growing interest in data science, business analytics, 
      and visualization.
    </p>

    <p>
      What motivates me most is taking open-ended, messy questions and using data to bring clarity, 
      whether for researchers, organisations, or student communities.

## Outside the Data World

- <strong>Football:</strong> I follow European football closely and enjoy thinking about the tactical and analytical side of the game.  
- <strong>Music:</strong> I play and perform music, which keeps me creative and comfortable in front of audiences.  
- <strong>Reading:</strong> I gravitate toward books on habits, systems, time management, and biographies.  
- <strong>Cooking:</strong> Cooking is where I slow down, experiment, and reset after busy weeks.

At my core, I am a curious and structured problem solver, combining analytical skills with communication and collaboration to create work that is both rigorous and practical.

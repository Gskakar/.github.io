# About Me

I've always been someone just observing patterns. From formations on a football field, melodies in music, or how numbers shape real-world decisions. Over time, this curiosity evolved into a passion for data.

With this peculiar interest being deepened in university through courses in statistics, data analysis and database systems. That’s where I discovered how data could be structured, analysed, and turned into insights. 

Since then, I’ve been building dashboards, analysing trends, and using Python, R, SQL, and Power BI to turn raw data into meaningful stories.

Today, I’m pursuing Computing Science at the University of Alberta with a growing focus on data science, business analytics, and visualization. I enjoy solving messy problems, creating clarity through data, and building tools that genuinely help people make informed decisions.

### Outside the Data World

When I’m not working with datasets or dashboards:

- **Football (Soccer)** is my escape and inspiration — I follow European leagues passionately and love understanding the tactical and analytical side of the game.
- **Music** is where I create. I enjoy composing, experimenting with melodies, and performing when I get the chance.
- I occasionally read, especially  thought provoking biographies.
- Cooking is my pause button when everything else feels too fast.

At my core, I’m someone who learns by exploring, from playing sports to performing music, from coding apps to analysing real-world problems. \

Data analytics became the bridge that connected my curiosity, creativity, and problem solving into something meaningful; and I’m still just getting started.

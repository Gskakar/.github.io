# About Me

<div class="side-by-side">
  <div class="text">
    My interest in problem-solving began with observing patterns—on a football field, in music, and in the way data shapes decisions. Over time, this curiosity evolved into a passion for understanding how systems work and how information can be used to make them better.

    At the University of Alberta, my academic work in statistics, data analysis, and database systems strengthened this interest. I learned how data can be structured, analysed, and transformed into insights that bring clarity to complex problems.

    Since then, I’ve built dashboards, analysed trends, and used tools such as Python, R, SQL, and Power BI to create meaningful, data-driven solutions. I am currently pursuing Computing Science with a growing focus on data science, analytics, and visualization.

I enjoy solving analytical challenges, bringing structure to unorganized information, and building tools that help people make informed decisions.

### Outside the Data World

- I follow European football closely and enjoy analysing tactics and gameplay.
- Music is another creative outlet—I compose, experiment with melodies, and perform when I can.
- I read regularly, especially books on personal growth, habits, and insightful biographies.
- Cooking is something I turn to when I need a break or a slower pace.

At my core, I’m someone who learns by exploring—whether through sports, music, coding, or analysing real-world systems. Data analytics became the bridge between my curiosity, creativity, and problem-solving mindset, and I continue building on that foundation with every project I take on.

# About Me

I've always been someone just observing patterns. From formations on a football field, melodies in music, or how numbers shape decisions in today's world. 

Over time, this curiosity evolved into a passion for uncovering stories hidden in using data to make sense of the systems around me.

With this peculiar interest being deepened in university through courses in statistics, data analysis and database systems. 

That’s where I discovered how data could be structured, analysed, and turned into insights. 

Since then, I’ve been building dashboards, analysing trends, and using Python, R, SQL, and Power BI to turn raw data into meaningful stories.

Today, I’m pursuing Computing Science at the University of Alberta with a growing focus on data sciences, business analytics, and visualizations. 

I enjoy solving messy problems, creating clarity through data, and building tools that genuinely help people make informed decisions.

### Outside the Data World

When I’m not working with datasets or dashboards:

- **Football (Soccer)** is my escape and inspiration — I follow European leagues passionately and love understanding the tactical and analytical side of the game.
- **Music** is where I create. I enjoy composing, experimenting with melodies, and performing when I get the chance.
- I enjoy reading when I can, especially books on habits, routines, time management, and insightful biographies.
- Cooking is my pause button, when everything else feels too fast...

At my core, I’m someone who learns by exploring, from playing sports to performing music, from coding apps to analysing real world problems.

Data analytics became the bridge that connected my curiosity, creativity, and problem solving into something meaningful; and I’m still just getting started 😉
